/*
  Handling disconnections
  - Now, let's highlight two really important properties of Socket.IO:
    # a Socket.IO client is not always connected
    # a Socket.IO server does not store any event


  ðŸ§µ Even over a stable network, it is not possible to maintain a connection alive forever.
    -> Which means that your application needs to be able to synchronize the local state of the client with the global state on the server after a temporary disconnection.


  ðŸ¥Œ The Socket.IO client will automatically try to reconnect after a small delay. However, any missed event during the disconnection period will effectively be lost for this client.


------------------------

  - But this is an awesome feature, why isn't this enabled by default?
  - There are several reasons for this:
    # it doesn't always work, for example if the server abruptly crashes or gets restarted, then the client state might not be saved
    # it is not always possible to enable this feature when scaling up

  Connection state recovery
  - First, let's handle disconnections by pretending that there was no disconnection: this feature is called "Connection state recovery".
  - This feature will temporarily store all the events that are sent by the server and will try to restore the state of a client when it reconnects:
    # restore its rooms
    # send any missed events
